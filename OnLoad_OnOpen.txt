Consider the order events falls in when opening/closing form:

OnOpen -> OnLoad -> Activate (I think) -> OnCurrent -> DeActivate -> OnUnLoad -> OnClose

Now, because of the ordering, you can cancel a OnOpen load, but not Load (as it's already open), and you can cancel a UnLoad (because it's not removed from screen just yet) but not the OnClose.

Open and Close events has to do with "loading" the forms into the memory but they are not quite on the screen.

Load/Unload event is when forms actually shows on the screen.

Activate/Deactive is when forms has focus or lost focus.

I hope that helps.
